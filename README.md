### Visual Analysis:  
- **Age vs. Survival Status:**  
  - Majority of deaths occur between ages 40 and 80.  
- **Serum Creatinine vs. Survival Status:**  
  - Higher serum creatinine levels indicate higher mortality.  
- **Age & Sex vs. Survival Status:**  
  - Male patients show higher death rates across most age groups.  
- **Platelets vs. Survival Status:**  
  - Lower platelet counts are more associated with mortality.  
- **Ejection Fraction vs. Survival Status:**  
  - Low ejection fraction (10–40) significantly correlates with higher mortality.  
- **Serum Sodium vs. Survival Status:**  
  - Sodium levels within normal range show higher survival rates.  
- **Creatinine Phosphokinase vs. Survival Status:**  
  - Extremely high levels are more associated with mortality.  
- **Time vs. Survival Status:**  
  - Patients monitored over longer periods tend to have better survival outcomes.  

### Insights & Recommendations:  
- **Focus on High-Risk Groups:** Monitoring patients with high serum creatinine, low ejection fraction, and low platelet counts can enhance patient care.  
- **Targeted Interventions:** Developing specific health plans for diabetic, hypertensive, and anemic patients can potentially improve survival rates.  
- **Gender-Based Analysis:** Implementing customized treatment plans for male patients who appear to be at higher risk.  

This dashboard provides valuable insights into heart failure survival, offering a comprehensive tool for making informed healthcare decisions.
